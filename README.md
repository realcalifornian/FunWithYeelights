# Introduction

Welcome to the **FunWithYeelights** package!

In this package, you'll find simple codes used effectively to mess with Yeelight bulbs in a multitude of ways

As a quick disclaimer, you must have a Yeelight at home in order for this package to serve a purpose AND make sure to change the IP address based on your specific Yeelight, as mine won't be the exact same as yours for obvious reasons.

Conversely, you can also statically assign your Yeelight an IP so that it falls in line with my scripts right off the bat. To do so, you must edit it through your router's administration, please research for more information!

Have fun!
